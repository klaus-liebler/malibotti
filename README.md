# Malibotti
Malibotti represents my initial effort to develop a drawing robot, building upon the concepts of the [ESP32-Drawing-Robot project](https://github.com/MatixYo/ESP32-Drawing-Robot). Key differentiators include a reduced reliance on 3D-printed parts and a custom PCB that functions dually as an electronic carrier and a mechanical structure. Additionally, a dedicated daughterboard with high-precision Hall-effect sensors provides servo arm position data, facilitating closed-loop feedback control for 360° servos.
